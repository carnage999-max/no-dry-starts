NO DRY STARTS®️ — WEBSITE CONTENT PACKAGE





THE PROBLEM: COLD START WEAR IS THE #1 SOURCE OF ENGINE DAMAGE


Every modern engine—gasoline or diesel—relies on a hydrodynamic oil film to separate the crankshaft, camshaft, and rod journals from their bearings. This film only exists after oil pressure builds.

During a cold start:

The crankshaft rests directly on the bearing surface
There is zero hydrodynamic lift
The first 1–3 seconds of operation occur under metal-to-metal contact
This is where up to 80% of all engine wear occurs
High-mileage engines suffer accelerated bearing clearance loss
Turbos experience dry-bearing scuff on startup
Cold temperatures increase oil viscosity, making the problem worse


Every start without oil pressure causes micro-damage that adds up over tens of thousands of miles.
Drivers never see it happening—but it’s the silent killer of engines.




THE SOLUTION: NO DRY STARTS®️ ELECTRIC ENGINE PRE-PRIMER SYSTEM


The No Dry Starts®️ system solves the root cause of startup wear by building full oil pressure before the starter ever engages.

How it works:

Driver turns the key or presses START
Our electric oil pump immediately activates
It floods the engine galleries and fills all bearings
The crank and cam journals are lifted onto a hydrodynamic oil film
Only after safe pressure is achieved does the system allow ignition
The engine starts fully lubricated—zero metal-to-metal contact


No complicated plumbing.
No external reservoirs.
No extra maintenance.
Installed between the block and oil filter as a self-contained module.

This is how engines should start—every time.




WHAT WE PROTECT


Our system prevents the exact mechanical injuries that destroy engines over time:


1. Main Bearing Wear


Cold starts grind the crankshaft journals into the soft bearing overlay layer.
Our system eliminates that contact entirely.


2. Rod Bearing Fatigue


Dry start knock is cumulative—thousands of micro-scuffs add up.
We prevent the scuffing cycle from ever beginning.


3. Cam Lobe & Lifter Wear


Overhead-cam engines are especially vulnerable.
We deliver oil to the top end before rotation.


4. Turbocharger Damage


Turbo bearings rely on hydrodynamic oil lift.
Dry startup is the fastest way to destroy a turbo.
We stop that by ensuring oil flow before spool.


5. Timing Chain Stretch


Cold-start lubrication delays accelerate chain wear.
Priming the system reduces load and stretch.




EXPECTED RESULTS: HOW MUCH LONGER WILL ENGINES LAST?


Based on known tribology data and hydrodynamic bearing research:


• Startup wear is reduced by up to 80–90%


Most engine wear happens in the first 1–3 seconds of operation.
We remove that entire phase of unprotected operation.


• Real-world engine life extension: 2× or more


A properly lubricated engine can double useful life because bearing clearance, cam lobe degradation, and ring wear are drastically reduced.

Projected gains:
Component
Expected Life Extension
Main bearings
2× – 3× longer life
Rod bearings
2× longer life
Cam/lifters
1.5× – 2× longer life
Turbocharger
2× – 4× longer life
Timing chain
1.5× longer life
Pistons/rings (due to better film strength)
1.2× – 1.5×

• Lower oil contamination


Less metal shedding = cleaner oil = longer oil life.


• Reduced low-RPM knock and cold scuff


Bearings stay concentric instead of scraping under load.


• Faster cold-start stabilization


The engine reaches smooth idle faster because friction is dramatically reduced.




WHY IT MATTERS


Every vehicle ever built suffers from dry-start damage.

Fleet owners, dealerships, municipalities, trucking companies, and high-performance engine builders all lose money because:

Rebuild cycles shorten
Oil analysis shows elevated bearing metals
Turbos fail prematurely
Engines develop low oil pressure with age
Cold climate operation accelerates wear dramatically


No Dry Starts®️ removes the single biggest source of internal engine destruction.

This is the first consumer-friendly system to solve the problem at the mechanical root—by ensuring no engine ever spins without lubrication pressure.




WHY OUR SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT


Fully self-contained assembly
Sandwich-mount design installs like a standard oil filter adapter
Integrated electric pump
Integrated pressure sensor
Integrated ignition lockout controller
No hoses, tanks, wiring mess, or failure-prone external plumbing
Universal platform: fits cars, trucks, diesel, performance engines, fleets


This is the first system built for mass-market adoption, not race-only or custom fab shops.
