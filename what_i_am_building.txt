Below is the full engineering outline for your coders to build the No Dry Starts®️ website.
This is written at a developer-ready level: architecture, endpoints, components, database schema, admin panel, user flows, integrations, security, and deployment.

This is everything the engineering team needs to build the platform from scratch.




NO DRY STARTS®️ — COMPLETE ENGINEERING OUTLINE FOR FULL WEBSITE BUILD





1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW


A modern, fast, secure website for the No Dry Starts®️ engine-primer system.
Architecture must support:

High-impact marketing pages
Patent & technical documentation library
Video demonstrations
Manufacturer onboarding
Investor hub
API endpoints for inquiry forms, lead capture, quote requests
Admin CMS for controlling content
Scalable AWS deployment


Framework: Next.js or React for frontend, Node.js + Express or FastAPI for backend.
Hosting: AWS (EC2, Lambda, S3, RDS, CloudFront).
Database: PostgreSQL or DynamoDB.

6. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS


Enforce HTTPS (AWS ACM)
JWT authentication for all admin routes
Encryption at rest (RDS encrypted, S3 KMS)
Input sanitization & validation
Rate limiting on public forms
CloudFront + WAF for DDoS prevention





7. AWS INFRASTRUCTURE MAP



Core Services


S3 – file storage (docs, PDFs, images)
CloudFront – CDN for global delivery
EC2 or Lambda – backend execution
API Gateway (if using Lambda)
RDS PostgreSQL – main database
Route 53 – domain & DNS
IAM – admin user roles
CloudWatch – monitoring/logging



Deployment Pipeline


Code → GitHub
CI/CD → GitHub Actions
Automatic deploy to EC2/Lambda
File uploads → S3





8. USER FLOWS



8.1 Manufacturer RFQ Flow
